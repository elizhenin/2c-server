# 2c-server
Reporting system, provided to replace sharing and collecting excel documents. Was based on nodejs server, NW.js thin client and LibreOffice Online for report editing.

In progress: replace LibreOffice Online to OnlyOffice (documentserver) due to non-stable working of first one.

Now without NW.js. Based on https://github.com/elizhenin/webserver project as backend, clientside 
logic, and linux PAM as user management.
